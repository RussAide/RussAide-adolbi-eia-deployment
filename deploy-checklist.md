## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version (should be 22)
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check build logs for specific errors

### App Doesn't Load
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify database connection
- Check deployment logs

### EIA Bot Not Working
- If on Netlify: Expected (no backend)

- Verify API endpoints are correct

### Database Connection Error
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set
- Check database service is running
- Run migrations: `pnpm run db:push`

## ✅ Final Recommendation

**Deploy to Railway for full functionality!**

1. Takes ~15 minutes
2. Everything works out of the box
3. Free $5/month credit
4. Professional permanent URL
5. Easy to maintain and update

**Avoid Netlify for this project** - it's designed for static sites, not full-stack apps.
